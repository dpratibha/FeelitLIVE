And why do we say it is one of the best bits? Allow us to let you in on a little theory that we have &ndash; For all of us at FeelAPlace, history is more than castles and palaces and exploits of the great and the mighty. For us, the most interesting stories often belong to the everyday business of living that the most unremarkable individuals spent their lives being busy with! Simply put, we believe that the history of the grain threshing machine and that of the hands that worked relentlessly to thresh that old grain is perhaps even more telling than the history of emperors and rulers and saints and merchants.</p>\n\n<p>Step inside St Augustine&rsquo;s Oldest Store Museum (which is really everything that is promised in the name itself &ndash; one oldest store coming up!) and you are transported back to the time of the early 20th century consumer boom. It is as if you have embarked on a journey through a Sears Roebuck catalogue. You name it, they have it on display. Very early on in your wanderings through this piece of history you tend to realize that life was pretty wonderful back then, courtesy of this treasure trove of a store.</p>\n\n<p>The Oldest Store Museum re-creates the original store that someone called Hamblen used to run in 1908. The extensive exhibits include live demonstrations of a snake oil salesman (a term used for a person who would sell wonderful sounding items that were totally useless), items from &ldquo;turn-of-the-century-living&rdquo; that comprise a grain thresher, a goat powered washing machine, steam-driven tractors, a worm syrup, old machinery, &ldquo;health underwear&rdquo;, corsets, guns, ammunitions, vintage bi and tricycles, farm equipment, elixirs and everything else under the 20th century sun. The museum guides act as the store clerks and salesmen to add that sweet touch of authenticity. Their play acting is all about history packaged with what we must let you know is a wonderful sense of humour. So be prepared to smile a lot and laugh a lot and feel like you are surrounded by the immense love so typical of this neck of the woods!</p>\n\n<p>The Oldest Store Museum houses more than 100,000 items, many of which are from the original store run by Hamblen. Unimaginable, right? You are welcome to try your hands on the various pieces of equipment to understand how it all worked.</p>\n\n<p>The Oldest Store Museum is more than a simple museum. It is an experience, which takes you back to an era when life was simple yet beautiful. The old world charm and the timeless Southern ambience add a unique dimension to the place. You literally start wondering about how amazing your life might have been, had you been a part of that fascinating time. And that is the hallmark of a great experience &ndash; it all feels so real to you!</p>\n\n<p>If you are in St. Augustine, do plan to visit this slice of history. The building, the exhibits and the guides keep you mesmerized. And under a friendly Southern Sun, you begin to experience that distinctly Southern feeling &ndash; a feeling called charm. Such a rare thing to find, such a privilege to feel!</p>\n",

				"description": "\r\nWhen you think of a palace in UK, the first names that come to your mind are inevitably and undoubtedly Buckingham or maybe even Windsor (though that’s a castle) and very few, if any, of you would think to think Blenheim! But it is indeed a palace and unlike all the other palaces in the world, it is not owned, operated and occupied by any Royal Family, not the Royal Family of Britain or Saudi Arabia.\r\n<br/><br/>It is in fact the only building in Britain to hold the title of “palace” not to be operated by the Royals. Built in Oxfordshire for the Dukes of Marlborough between 1705 and 1722, the Blenheim Palace is in fact just a mansion that was gifted by Queen Anne to the 1st Duke of Marlborough John Churchill (yes, the ancestor of that Churchill) for his military victory in 1704 against the French in the Battle of Blenheim. So it is no coincidence then that the Blenheim Palace was gifted to a man who stuffed the French in Blenheim, which is in Germany. Ah, the British.\r\n<br/><br/>And where did the money for this massive project that took 17 years to complete come from? Why, the Parliament of course! Why use your own money when you can be rewarded for sending the French packing! The construction however was delayed due to disputes between the Marlborough family and the Royals. \r\n<br/><br/>And at the heart of one of these was the Duchess of Marlborough, Sarah Jennings. Years before the construction or in fact the battle in which the French were beaten with their baguettes, Sarah Jennings had been good friends with Princess Anne who would later go on to become the Queen. When Princess turned Queen, Sarah Jennings was granted the title of Mistress of the Robes (what does a Mistress of the Robes do? Manage what everyone wears? We may never know) which was one of the highest honours for a lady.\r\n<br/><br/>However, years later she had a falling out with the Queen in 1711 and by now the Duke of Marlborough too was on the Queen’s bad side. All this meant that the funding for the Palace, which was Parliament controlled mind you, was cut. The entire family, in typical British soap-opera fashion, was banished from the Queen’s court and sent into years of exile and they only returned in 1714 following the Queen’s death.\r\n<br/><br/>The Duchess wanted the famed architect Sir Christopher Wren to design the palace. The Duke wanted Sir John Vanbrugh. The Queen wanted to honour the Duke for badgering the French and the Parliament was being stingy. And so, there were constant fights about the design, funding, reasoning, scale, grandeur and extravagance between the Duke, Duchess, Parliament, Queen, Wren and Vanbrugh.\r\n<br/><br/>All that this ultimately resulted in was the Queen banishing the Duke and Duchess. That only goes to show, you can’t have your cake and eat it too.\r\n<br/><br/>But eat the cake they did (i.e they got their palace) when Queen Anne kicked the Royal bucket. When they returned, construction resumed but this time Parliament had washed their hands of the matter and the money was coming out of the Duke’s pocket (that’s what you get for arguing with the Queen; you have to build your own house).\r\n<br/><br/>Intrigued, already? Go visit Blenheim Palace. Feel thoroughly, thoroughly entertained!",
